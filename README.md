# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction
This data science project aims to predict the quality of red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset consists of physicochemical (input) and sensory (output) variables, with no information about grape types, wine brand, or selling price due to privacy and logistic constraints.

The dataset can be approached as either a classification or regression task. The quality scores are ordered and not evenly distributed, meaning there are significantly more normal wines than excellent or poor ones.
